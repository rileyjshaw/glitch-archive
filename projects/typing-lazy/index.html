		<h1>typing lazy</h1>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>
			Try touch-typing an English word without moving your fingers from their resting position on the keyboard. As
			a reminder, the resting keys for your left hand are "A", "S", "D", and "F". The keys for your right hand are
			"J", "K", "L", and ";".
		</p>
		<p>For example, "HELLO" can be typed by hitting the keys "J", "D", "L", "L", and "L" in order.</p>
		<p>
			Once you're finished, hit the spacebar to make your word appear. If there's more than one possible word, hit
			the spacebar again to cycle through.
		</p>
		<h2>Example</h2>
		<p>Try typing "SPAGHETTI IS YUMMY" by hitting the following keys:</p>
		<p>
			<strong
				>S ; A F J D F F K &lt;space&gt; K S &lt;space&gt; J J J J J &lt;space&gt; &lt;space&gt;
				&lt;space&gt;</strong
			>
